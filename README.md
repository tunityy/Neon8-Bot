# Neon8-Discord-Bot
*A discord bot I'm attempting to make to do some useful things for playing Vampire the Masquerade 5e.*
&nbsp;  
## Things That I'm Using
* **Python 3.5.3 or higher** is required, at minimum. Probably higher though, I'm not really sure. But discord.py requires Python 3.5.3 I am making this bot in [Python 3.9.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-392/), the most recent stable version at this time.

* **[Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) API wrapper** 

* **[SQLite 3.35](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)**. The RETURNING clause is new in 3.35, which just came out in March 2021, so some of my code won't work without it.

## Currently Working On...

### Database Stuff!

Trying to make it so I can look up character stats in the database, in various combinations.
